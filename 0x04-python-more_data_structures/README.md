0x04. Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

This README.md file provides a brief overview of key concepts related to Python data structures (sets, dictionaries) and functional programming concepts (lambda functions, map, reduce, filter functions). Adjust or expand each topic as needed to align with your specific learning objectives or project focus.


Why Python Programming is Awesome:

    Python is renowned for its readability, versatility, and extensive standard library, making it suitable for various applications.

    Sets:

        Definition and Usage: Sets are collections of unique elements used to store data without duplicates.
	    Common Methods: Methods like add(), remove(), union(), intersection(), etc., manipulate sets.
	        When to Use Sets: Use sets for unique data where membership and uniqueness are important.
		    Iteration: Iteration over a set is straightforward using a for loop.

		    Dictionaries:

		        Definition and Usage: Dictionaries store data as key-value pairs for fast retrieval based on keys.
			    When to Use Dictionaries: They are ideal for mapping relationships where keys are unique identifiers.
			        Keys: Keys in dictionaries uniquely identify values stored within them.
				    Iteration: Dictionaries can be iterated over using for loops to access keys, values, or key-value pairs.

				    Lambda Functions and Functional Programming:

				        Lambda Functions: Small anonymous functions defined using the lambda keyword.
					    Map, Reduce, Filter Functions:
					            map(): Applies a function to each item in an iterable.
						            filter(): Filters elements based on a condition.
							            reduce(): Applies a rolling computation to sequential pairs of values.
